# Welcome to HomeSec!

You are a data thief that wants to access some sensitive info about a guy named Bob Wilkinson that works for a big tech company. After spending some time in the shadow you know exactly when Bob goes to work and when he comes back home (very creepy by the way). You also found out that Bob will spend a week on holiday. This gives you enough time to go to his house and look for valuable intel. In order not to let anyone enter his house, Bob installed a custom security system in his house, that only allows him to enter the house. And that's where the fun begins. You know that Bob is not the best engineer in the world, so his system has flaws. 
Since you have on-site access to his security system, you can turn on your laptop and hacking devices in order to get as much intel as possible about his device. The security device also stores some sensitive information about the home owner. Good enough for the black market :).

If you can also get into his house by cloning the data from the garage key, you get bonus points.
